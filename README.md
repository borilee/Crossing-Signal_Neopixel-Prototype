# Description
This is an <a href ="https://github.com/arduino/Arduino">Arduino</a> code for a prototype of an autonomous vehicle that communicates with pedestrians to cross through a color signal surrounding windshield. It used Neopixels and bluetooth modules. 

# About This Project
<p>This repository is a part of a project for Human Robot Interaction course by Henny Admoni at Carnegie Mellon University in 2018 Spring.
Ashlesha Dhotey, Bori Lee, Chirag Murthy, and Rossa Kim have explored how autonomous vehicles can communicate its intent with pedestrians in the scenarios without traffic signal.
This project primarily focuses on color as a means of communication. A scaled-down model of a vehicle equipped with Neopixels and bluetooth modules was created to conduct a user test for the communication.</p>
